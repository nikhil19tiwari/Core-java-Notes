Exception
=========
=> An unwanted/expected event that disturbs the normal flow of execution of program is called "Exception handling".
=> The main objective of Exception handling is to handle the exception.
=> It is available for graceful termination of program.



What is the meaning of Exception handling?
 Exception handling means not repairing the exception.
 We have to define alternative way to continue rest of the program normally.
 This way of defining an alternative is nothing but "Exception handling".

example
   Suppose our programming requirement is to read a data from a file locating at one location,
   At run time if the file is not available then our programm should terminate succesfully.
   Solution:: Provide the local file to terminate the program succesfully,This way of defining alternative is nothing but "Exception handling".


eg#1.
   try{
      read data from London file
   }
   catch(FileNotFoundException e){
     use local file and continue rest of the program normally
   }
